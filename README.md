# GetYourGuide
A GYG iOS Engineer Challenge.

##### Guidelines
  - The app UI does not need to handle orientation changes
  - The app does not need to manage user registration and/or authentication
  - The app should function offline in any scenario (e.g. first time and returning user)
  - he app should allow users to browse all of the reviews if they wish; additionally, you       may decide which filters, if any, maybe useful Mock the API in the app for submitting
    reviews and let us know how you would structure the POST payload and response.
  - For simplicity sake, no branding or UI guidelines need to be met.
  - The final deliverable will be a link to an accessible Git repository containing all of
    the code necessary to build and install the app along with a README.md with relevant   
    information
